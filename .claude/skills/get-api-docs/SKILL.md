  Use this skill when you need documentation for a third-party library, SDK, or API
  before writing code that uses it — for example, "use the OpenAI API", "call the
  Stripe API", "use the Anthropic SDK", "query Pinecone", or any time the user asks
  you to write code against an external service and you need current API reference.
  Fetch the docs with chub before answering, rather than relying on training knowledge.

# Get API Docs via chub

When you need documentation for a library or API, fetch it with the `chub` CLI
rather than guessing from training data. This gives you the current, correct API.

## Step 1 — Find the right doc ID

```bash
chub search "<library name>" --json
```

Pick the best-matching `id` from the results (e.g. `openai/chat`, `anthropic/sdk`,
`stripe/api`). If nothing matches, try a broader term.

## Step 2 — Fetch the docs

```bash
chub get <id> --lang py    # or --lang js, --lang ts
```

Omit `--lang` if the doc has only one language variant — it will be auto-selected.

## Step 3 — Use the docs

Read the fetched content and use it to write accurate code or answer the question.
Do not rely on memorized API shapes — use what the docs say.

## Step 4 — Annotate what you learned

After completing the task, if you discovered something not in the doc — a gotcha,
workaround, version quirk, or project-specific detail — save it so future sessions
start smarter:

```bash
chub annotate <id> "Webhook verification requires raw body — do not parse before verifying"
```

Annotations are local, persist across sessions, and appear automatically on future
`chub get` calls. Keep notes concise and actionable. Don't repeat what's already in
the doc.

## Step 5 — Give feedback

Always rate the doc after using it. This helps authors fix outdated or incorrect
docs and prioritize improvements. Include a label and a brief comment explaining
what was good or what needs fixing — specific feedback is the most valuable.

```bash
chub feedback <id> up --label accurate "Clear examples, models are current"
chub feedback <id> down --label outdated "Lists gpt-4o as latest but gpt-5.4 is out"
```

Available labels: `outdated`, `inaccurate`, `incomplete`, `wrong-examples`,
`wrong-version`, `poorly-structured`, `accurate`, `well-structured`, `helpful`,
`good-examples`.

If you notice the doc has wrong model names, deprecated APIs, missing features,
or incorrect code patterns, always leave a downvote with details so it can be fixed.

## Quick reference

| Goal              | Command                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| List everything   | `chub search`                                 |
| Find a doc        | `chub search "stripe"`                        |
| Exact id detail   | `chub search stripe/api`                      |
| Fetch Python docs | `chub get stripe/api --lang py`               |
| Fetch JS docs     | `chub get openai/chat --lang js`              |
| Save to file      | `chub get anthropic/sdk --lang py -o docs.md` |
| Fetch multiple    | `chub get openai/chat stripe/api --lang py`   |
| Save a note       | `chub annotate stripe/api "needs raw body"`   |
| List notes        | `chub annotate --list`                        |
| Rate a doc        | `chub feedback stripe/api up`                 |

## Adding project-local docs

Project-specific docs live in `.claude/chub/content/` and are committed to the repo.
To add a new doc, create a `DOC.md` under the appropriate path:

```
.claude/chub/content/<author>/docs/<name>/<lang>/DOC.md
```

Then rebuild the registry:

```bash
chub build .claude/chub/content -o .claude/chub
```

Commit both the `DOC.md` and the updated `registry.json`.

## Notes

- `chub search` with no query lists everything available
- IDs are `<author>/<name>` — confirm the ID from search before fetching
- If multiple languages exist and you don't pass `--lang`, chub will tell you which are available
- Project-local docs are served from `.claude/chub/` (configured in `~/.chub/config.yaml`)
